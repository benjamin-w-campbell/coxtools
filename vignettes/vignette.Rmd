# Vignette Info and Introduction
This vignette uses the Stanford Heart Transplant made available through [@survival-book] but originally taken from [@crowley1977covariance].  It is relatively small as it is really only designed to walk through a few essential functions.  We will fit a relatively simplistic Cox PH model on the [@crowley1977covariance] data and then use the functions available in this `coxtools` package.  

# Fitting Model
In this section, we fit a relatively simplistic Cox PH Model that attempts to predict the time until an event between some entry time and some exit time.  Only a few covariates are included, including the age of the patient, prior bypass surgery, and if they recieved the transplant.  The code for this is as follows:
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Load survival package
library(survival)
# Import data
data("heart")
# Coerce from factor
heart$transplant <- as.numeric(heart$transplant)
# Rescale age
heart$age <- heart$age+48
# Fit model
coxph_fit <- coxph(Surv(start, stop, event) ~
                     age + transplant +surgery,
                   data = heart,
                   x = TRUE)
```

# `coxtools` Functions
The `coxtools` package comes with a series of functions that are useful in assessing model fit.
